# Fancy Browser Helper

This is a collection of DOM helpers, keyboard keycodes, and more (but not much more) for Haxe. Think of it as jQuery, but without most of the features and with none of the cross-browser normalization. Mostly, this provides some helpful extension methods on top of `js.html.Element` in Haxe.

This was extracted without any modification from [FancySearch](https://github.com/mlms13/FancySearch). It wasn't originally intended to be a reusable library, but I have use for it in other `fancy.*` libraries, so here it is.
